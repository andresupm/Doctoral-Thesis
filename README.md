This repository contains the main files used during the developing the contributions described in the doctoral thesis entitled "CONTRIBUCIÓN AL MODELO DE GESTIÓN Y ORQUESTACIÓN DE REDES PARTICIONADAS 5G EN ENTORNOS MULTI-DOMINIO Y MULTI-CLIENTE". The files are stored in different directories which are described below: 

- The SIT-Descriptors directory contains the example yaml files used to validate the provision of management systems to MVNOs. It comprises SIT, NSD and VND files wich define the Tele-operated Driving and 5G Services
- On the other hand, the Script-Run-Environment directory contains all the scripts and files needed to prepare the scenario in VNX to validate the contribution on VNF sharing. 
- The Deep-Learning-Models directory includes the models defined in python files used to predict the computational resource consumption of the VNFs, as well as the k-means algorithm to classify the VNFs into the three types. Finally, the SDN-app directory contains the SDN application to enable traffic forwarding between the exhausted VNF and the shared VNF.
